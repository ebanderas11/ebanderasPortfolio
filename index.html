                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Ernesto Banderas - a self taught font-end developer from and based in Los Angeles,
                    California.
                    I have been working with HTML, CSS, and JS for the past year mainly focusing on building Web Sites
                    for small clients.
                    I am currently attending Long Beach City College while I get my A.S. in Web Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not working on Web Dev projects you can find me messing with coffee, collecting cards, or
                    playing video games.
                    Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work with me or get to know more about me.
                </p>

            <h2>Reflections</h2>

            <div class="reflection-card">
                <h3>User Experience</h3>
                <p> One of the most important topics we covered in our Front End Web Dev class is User Experience.
                    The way users interact with the website and how easy it is to use overall will ultimately determine
                    if
                    you website will be succesful in retaining users or drive them away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to consider all users when creating your website, but I believe it is more important
                    to
                    find the audience you are catering to and design a website based off of that. Of course I want my
                    site to be
                    accessable by all, but at the end of the day it is my target audience that will decide if they will
                    use the site
                    or not.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is important to look up your user demographic and understand user habits. This way you can plan
                    ahead
                    and build accordingly.
                    It is easy to do the research in the beginning as opposed to after your site is published.
                </p>


            </div>
            <div class="reflection-card">
                <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Today most of use our phones for daily tasks that we would normally do on a computer. Most website
                    users today access
                    websites from their phones. That's why it is especially important to make sure your website is
                    mobile responsive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I like to build my websites with a mobile first approach. I build everything out
                    starting off with how
                    it will look on a mobile device. Once the site looks good on mobile, I start to scale the site to
                    bigger screen sizes
                    such as tablets or computer monitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A mobile responsive site can be achieved using tools such as flex-box and media queries. I like to
                    combine
                    the two to create clean and responsive sites.
                </p>

                <img src="resources/frontEndproject1.png" alt="">
                <div class="description-container">
                    <p>This was the first tribute page for our Intro to Front End class. It serves great starter project
                        for
                        those learning the front end side of web development. I used a simple design to keep things
                        clean
                        and easy to read. The page focuses on Satoshi Tajiri, the creator of Pokemon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I could redo this page, I would certainly add more details about Satoshi's life and more user
                        interaction.
                        As it is now, it kind of just reminds me of a wiki page, so it could defenitely use more work.
                        The idea behind
                        this page was to just make something super simple and responsive.

                <div class="description-container">
                    <p>This project focuses on creating a landing page for a specific product. I recreated the Slayer
                        Espresso
                        Machine web page. It was goood practice using flex box and the css box model. I mainly focused
                        on
                        keeping the design simple and easy to use. All information is easil legible and navigation is
                        layed out
                        cleanly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only issue I had with this page was that I did not add a landscape mode for my media
                        queries. I should
                        have started out with a mobile first approach and then scaled the site to bigger screens.

                        <p>
                            Using repl.it we modified JSON and used AJAX to create a single page application that
                            basically
                            updates on the same page. Whenever you click for more info to come up, the info is added to
                            the current page
                            instead of having a new page open for the specific info. It also allows for the page to be
                            more compressed and
                            have less clutter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall this was a good introduction to JSON/AJAX. It helped understand why using JS and
                            JSON together
                            is so useful.

                    <p>This project was built using the very basics of React on codepen. It is meant to show how JSX and
                        React
                        work. React is simple, straight forward, and quick. Using React I built a SPA with some simple
                        navigation
                        between pages. The project does not show the full power of React, but it simply shows how you
                        could create
                        small bits of reusable code, such as the code for the navigation and footer.

                    <p>
                        Overall this project helped me undertsand some of the basics of React and provided good practice
                        with
                        a popular framework.

                        focused on a Pokemon adventure where you pick your Pokemon and destination. Once you pick a
                        destination you encounter
                        an enemy Pokemon. Here a randomizing function is used to flip a coin and decide whether your
                        attacks land or not. A function
                        divides your wins and losses by 3 and if your attacks landed more than 1/3rd of the times you
                        attacked, you win.

                    <p>
                        Overall this project was a fun introduction to functions and adding user interactiveness to
                        sites or creating simple games.
                        If I could keep working on this project, I would surely add more functions, interactions, and

                        character. Finally the JS outputs onto the HTML everything that will be displayed on the page.
                        It creates your character
                        and a random enemy character and then gives them both stats and attributes. Once everything is
                        displayed on the page
                        you could see which one of the characters has better stats.

                        This project helped with understanding arrays, functions, prototype functions and object
                        contructors.

                            Using repl.it we modified JSON and used AJAX to create a single page application that
                            basically
                            updates on the same page. Whenever you click for more info to come up, the info is added to
                            the current page
                            instead of having a new page open for the specific info. It also allows for the page to be
                            more compressed and
                            have less clutter.

                            Overall this was a good introduction to JSON/AJAX. It helped understand why using JS and
                            JSON together
                            is so useful.

                                This project allowed us to use JS to validate user input. We modified a form using JS in
                                order to
                                have it validate user input such as user name, passwords, email, and a short bio. It was
                                useful because
                                it showed how JS can be used as a backend tool to help with forms such as this.
